## What are you learning?

You'll start by learning how to use Telerik AppBuilder—including how to start NativeScript apps, how to deploy them devices, and how see your changes during development. From there you'll start building a basic NativeScript app.

## Step 1: Clone the repo

* On <https://platform.telerik.com> click the blue **Create app** button.
* On the next screen, select **Start from a blank app**, and give the app a name of ”JustMeme”.
* Click the green **Create app** button.
* Click the green **Create AppBuilder Native project**.
* Select **Clone repository**, use https://step-1-link.git for a Repository Uri, and “MemeGen Lab 1” for a project name.
* Click the green **Create project** button.

## Step 2: Deploy to companion app

After creating the project you're taken into the AppBuilder environment. AppBuilder offers a lot of functionality, including a full IDE and integrated version control, but you'll start by using AppBuilder to get your app onto a device.

* In the **Run** menu, select **Build**.
* Choose your device's OS (Android or iOS), make sure the **NativeScript companion app** radio button is selected, and then click the green **Next** button.
* Open the NativeScript app on your Android or iOS device.
	* (If you don't have the NativeScript app download it from the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript/id882561588?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telerik.NativeScript&hl=en)).
* **Android only**: With the NativeScript app running, open the notification drawer from the top of the screen. Select the **Scan** option and use the integrated scanner to scan the QR code you see in the browser.
* **iOS only**: Within the NativeScript app, use a two-finger left-to-right swipe (see image below) from the far left to reveal the companion app menu. Select the **QR Scanner** option and use the integrated scanner to scan the QR code you see in the browser.
