# Telerik MEME Generator

This uses the NativeScript CLI. Here's a guide to get started with it: http://developer.telerik.com/?p=32341&shareadraft=baba32341_54c016f97a14a, but don't share that link publicly (yet).

Assuming you have the [CLI prerequisites](https://github.com/nativescript/nativescript-cli#system-requirements) installed, you can run this app by cloning the repo and running `tns run ios --emulator` or `tns run android --emulator`.
