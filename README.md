This repository contains the presentations, labs and the {N}  application used in the “NativeScript Deep Dive” workshop at [TelerikNEXT](http://teleriknext.com/).

Tags: TelerikNEXT, NativeScript, {N}, JavaScript, CSS3, iOS, Android

# Pre-Requisites

Throughout the workshop we will be working in the [Telerik Platform](http://platform.telerik.com). While the Telerik Platform supports both a web based IDE and the CLI, we will only be working in the Web editor, AppBuilder. From there, you can easily build and deploy the application to either the {N} app or, if you have a device with a developer account, directly to your device.

## Required

* A Browser (Your Choice)
* [Telerik Platform](http://platform.telerik.com) Account. Free Trial is enough.
* The NativeScript App
    * [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript/id882561588?mt=8)
    * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telerik.NativeScript&hl=en)

## Required if you want to side-load
* Device and developer account, at least one Android 4.2+ or iOS 7+ device

# Workshop Goals
Our goal of this workshop is to introduce you to NativeScript or {N}. NativeScript just released and a new world had been born. At the end of the day you will have build a {N} application, while exploring different parts of the {N} architecture, framework and modules. A mixture of both presentations, and labs will run the entirety of the day.

We’ve chosen to walk your through building mobile application which exercises {N}, the Telerik Platform and is fun. How do you create fun? By building a Meme generator of course! Our day will be highly interactive with a good mixture of presentations and hand on coding. At the end, you'll have an app, and you'll have spammed your friends with the meme images you've always wanted to build.

# Presentations

1. [Welcome to NativeScript](http://tbd.com)
2. [Beyond the Basics](http://tbd.com) 
3. [Diving Deep with {N}](http://tbd.com) 

# Labs
Each lab is structured in two distinct parts. A starting project and a finished project. Each lab builds on what you completed in the lab prior. While we do provide a starting point each time it’s not required for you to start there if you would like to advance your own project. 

You will find each lab in its own GitHub repository. Our desire is to easily enable you to run each of these side by side in Telerik’s AppBuilder. 

The lab steps are all contained in this repository which serves as our master repository.

Now of course we’re human, so if you find a mistake, please feel free to submit a patch.
