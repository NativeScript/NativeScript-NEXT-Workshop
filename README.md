# NativeScript {N} Workshop

This repository contains a series of presentations and labs for teaching the basics of NativeScript. These materials were first used during the “NativeScript Deep Dive” workshop at [TelerikNEXT](http://teleriknext.com/), however, the materials were designed to let anyone go through the workshop on their own time.

The workshop is divided into six steps: three presentations and three hands-on labs. By reading the slides and going through the hands-on labs, you'll learn the basics of how to build apps with NativeScript. You'll also build a [meme generator](https://github.com/NativeScript/JustMeme) you can use to impress (or annoy) your friends and family.

## Pre-Requisites

Before you start this workshop you must have the following things in place:

* A browser (your choice)
* A [Telerik Platform](http://platform.telerik.com) account (the free trial is enough)
* At least one Android 4.2+ or iOS 7+ device
* The NativeScript app installed on your device(s)
    * [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript/id882561588?mt=8)
    * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telerik.NativeScript&hl=en)

## Steps

Steps #1, #3, and #5 are presentations. Steps #2, #4, and #6 are labs. Each presentation was designed to introduce a lab. Therefore the presentation in step #1 provides information you'll use in the lab in step #2; the presentation in step #3 provides information you'll use in step #4; and so on.

Each of the three labs provide a starting project, a finished project, and instructions that help you work from the starting project to the finished one. Each project resides in its own GitHub repo, so you can run the projects side by side if necessary.

If you run into any issues completing the workshop, or you find a bug we haven't noticed, please [create an issue](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript-NEXT-Workshop/issues/new) or send a pull request.
